# MavLinkMadeEasy
Summer 2018- CSCI 4830-860 Software Engineering: Project Party

Have you ever struggled to figure out your next semester at UNO? Does it take you more time than you'd like to 
check MavLink, DegreeWorks, and the class enrollment catalog to determine what you need to take and the most
efficient schedule?

MavLinkMadeEasy strives to simplify your course schedule. Instead of wasting another 30 minutes of your advisor's
life, just log in, pop in a few details about your degree plan and the classes you've already taken, and MLME will provide you
with a list and rotation schedule to help you get that paper sooner!

This project is a work in progress by the CSCI 4830-860 pyParty team.
